# Chain-of-Custody
The chain of custody is the documented process that tracks the collection, handling, transfer, and storage of evidence from the time it is collected until it is presented in court. Maintaining a proper chain of custody is crucial because it ensures:
•	Evidence Integrity: It proves that the evidence has not been altered, tampered with, or mishandled.
•	Authenticity: It ties the evidence directly to the crime or incident under investigation, ensuring that the evidence is what it claims to be.
•	Legal Admissibility: Courts require proof that the evidence was collected, transferred, and stored correctly without any changes. If the chain of custody is broken, the evidence could be deemed inadmissible, and the case may be compromised.

# Key Steps in Establishing and Preserving a Chain of Custody
The following steps outline the process of establishing and preserving the chain of custody for digital evidence:

1. Collection of Evidence: The evidence is collected at the scene (e.g., a computer, hard drive, or memory stick). At this point, the person collecting the evidence must document what was collected, from where, and at what time.
2. Labeling of Evidence:  Every piece of evidence is clearly labeled with a unique identifier. This includes recording the date, time, location, and details about the person collecting the evidence.

3. Documentation of each Process: chain of custody form is filled out, noting every person who handles the evidence, what actions they took, and when the evidence was transferred between individuals or locations.
4. Transfer: When evidence is moved (e.g., from the crime scene to a lab), it must be properly documented. The receiving party must sign the chain of custody form, indicating the date and time of the transfer.
5. Storage: Evidence is stored in a secure location (e.g., a forensics lab or evidence locker) to prevent unauthorized access. The conditions of storage must be documented, and access should be restricted.
6. Analysis: When the evidence is analyzed (e.g., a hard drive is imaged), the actions taken must be documented, including the tools used and the findings obtained from the analysis.
7. Presentation in Court: When the evidence is presented in court, the chain of custody records is submitted to show that the evidence has been handled properly throughout the investigation.

# Example Scenario:Broken Chain of Custody
# Scenario: 
A digital forensics investigator was contacted to handle a case. He arrives at the crime scene collects evidence from a suspect’s laptop, which contains incriminating files. The investigator brings the laptop to the forensics lab but fails to document the transfer of the laptop from the crime scene to the lab. Also, the laptop is left unsecured overnight in the lab, and multiple people handled it without proper documentation and they worked on the original disk.

#Consequence:
In court, the defense attorney argues that the chain of custody was broken since the transfer wasn’t documented and the evidence wasn’t securely stored. The attorney suggests that the files could have been altered or tampered with after collection. As a result, the judge rules that the digital evidence is inadmissible, and the case against the suspect is significantly weakened or dismissed.
